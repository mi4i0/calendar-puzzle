# Calendar Puzzle Solver & Visualizer

Interactive playground for the classic 679 calendar pentomino puzzle:
- **Python solver (`solver.py`)** finds exact-cover layouts for a chosen month/day/weekday and exports a `solution.json` payload.
- **Web UI (`index.html` + `visualizer.js`)** renders the board, lets you pick any date, and solves entirely in-browser using a JavaScript backtracking engine. You can also load the JSON produced by the Python script.

## Getting Started

### 1. Python solver (optional, for reference solutions)
```bash
python solver.py
```
This prints an ASCII layout and generates `solution.json` with:
- board labels and metadata,
- which cells stay open (month/day/weekday),
- placements of each pentomino.

### 2. Browser visualizer
Open `index.html` via any static server (e.g. VS Code Live Server or `python -m http.server`).
The UI lets you:
1. Pick month / day / weekday combo.
2. Click **Solve (JS)** to run the solver directly in the browser.
3. Optionally click **Load solution.json** to import the file generated by Python.
4. Hover pieces/legend/placements to highlight shapes on the grid.

### 3. Hosting on GitHub Pages
The project is static, so you can deploy by pushing the files to a GitHub repo and enabling GitHub Pages (e.g. branch `main`, folder `/`). No backend is required.

## File overview

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `solver.py` | Exact-cover solver in Python; also exports JSON for the UI. |
| `index.html` | Styled UI shell (controls + board + legend + placements list). |
| `visualizer.js` | Front-end solver + renderer (JS backtracking, highlighting, JSON load). |
| `solution.json` | Generated output from Python solver (optional to commit). |

Enjoy exploring the daily calendar challenge! Feel free to customize pentomino colors, add more presets, or integrate alternate puzzle variants.
